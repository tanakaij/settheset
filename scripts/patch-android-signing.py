Give every build the SAME signing identity and an INCREASING versionCode.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS EXISTS — this is the "I have to cancel the first install, then go for
update the second time" bug, and it is also what wiped the survey data.

`android/` is not committed; `npx cap add android` regenerates it on every run,
and `./gradlew assembleDebug` signs with Gradle's *auto-generated* debug key at
~/.android/debug.keystore. A GitHub Actions runner is a fresh VM, so that file
never exists and Gradle quietly creates a BRAND NEW RANDOM KEY on every single
build. Every APK therefore carries a different signature.

Android will not update an installed app whose signature does not match the
incoming one (INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE). The package installer's only
route forward is uninstall-then-install — which is exactly the cancel/retry
dance, and which deletes /data/data/com.settheset.app. The WebView's localStorage
lives in there. That is where the services, the song library and every
setting went: not a crash inside the app, but the installer removing the app
directory because the new APK could not be recognised as the same app.

On top of that, `cap add android` always writes versionCode 1, so even with
matching signatures Android sees every build as a same-version reinstall.

This script fixes both: a persistent keystore (checked in under signing/, or
supplied via the ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64 secret) applied to the build type that is
actually shipped, and a versionCode derived from the CI run number.

Safe to run more than once; it is a no-op if already applied.

# ══ WHY THERE IS A FLOOR ══
# versionCode came straight from GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER, which counts up reliably — but only WITHIN
# ONE REPO. Deleting the repo and creating a fresh one resets that counter to 1, while the phone
# still has the old APK installed at whatever number the old repo reached. Android requires a
# strictly GREATER versionCode to update in place, so the new build is a downgrade and the
# install fails with INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE — surfaced to the user as a bare
# "App not installed".
#
# The tempting fix at that point is to uninstall first, and that deletes /data/data/com.settheset.app
# — every service, song and arrangement on the device. The whole point of the stable keystore
# above is to make uninstalling unnecessary, and a reset run counter quietly undoes it.
#
# So the run number is treated as an OFFSET above a floor rather than as the version itself.
# 1000 is chosen to sit clearly above any run count a repo of this age could have reached, and
# it only ever needs raising if a future repo is deleted again after 1000+ builds.
